# Subscribe HLS Only
This is an example of subscribing to a stream using HLS Only. By default the SDK support HLS failover support for browsers that support HLS natively (i.e., Desktop & Mobile Safari).

In the event that HLS is not supported natively by the browser, the [hls.js](https://video-dev.github.io/hls.js/) 3rd-party library is utilized.
